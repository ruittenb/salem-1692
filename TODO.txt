SEVERE:
 - with ghost players, the constable is allowed to choose themselves
   - done: FR, DE, EN, ES
     - todo: NL
 - add players form: font size condensed for placeholder
 - title for daytime page

IMPORTANT:
 - Safari: backgroundmusic sometimes(?) as loud as speech
 - right after mounting: preserve slave/master status? in localstorage?

NICE TO HAVE:
 - cleanup "connecting" bubble when hosting
 - add button "abort connecting"
 - nicer wifi icon
 - fade music out
 - reflect state in URL https://betterprogramming.pub/how-and-why-you-should-store-react-ui-state-in-the-url-f2013a204cb2
