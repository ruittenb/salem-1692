SEVERE:
 - in master mode, during dawn, one line of speech is skipped (witch-go-to-sleep)

IMPORTANT:
 - right after mounting: preserve slave/master status? in localstorage?
 - ghost players

NICE TO HAVE:
 - show "connecting" in text bubble when starting master mode
 - add button "abort connecting"
 - nicer wifi icon
 - fade music out
 - reflect state in URL https://betterprogramming.pub/how-and-why-you-should-store-react-ui-state-in-the-url-f2013a204cb2
