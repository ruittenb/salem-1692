SEVERE:
 - town-still-asleep recordings
   - done: fr, pt, it, de
	 - todo: nl, en, es

IMPORTANT:
 - right after mounting: preserve slave/master status? in localstorage?
 - the "choose no one" option for the constable (and witches?) in ghost mode

NICE TO HAVE:
 - Safari: backgroundmusic sometimes(?) as loud as speech
 - add button "abort connecting"
 - fade music out
 - reflect state in URL https://betterprogramming.pub/how-and-why-you-should-store-react-ui-state-in-the-url-f2013a204cb2
 - swipe: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-swipeable
 - top bar in layout with buttons

 - reveal buttons: combine PRE and POST parts and use templates {1} etc.
