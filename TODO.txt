SEVERE:
 -

IMPORTANT:
 - prevent flicker in slave night pages
 - right after mounting: preserve slave/master status? in localstorage?

NICE TO HAVE:
 - show "connecting" in text bubble when starting master mode
 - add button "abort connecting"
 - Dawn background
 - nicer wifi icon
 - fade music out
