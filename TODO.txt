SEVERE:
 - Version: 15.4
 - Safari: backgroundmusic sometimes(?) too loud (as loud as speech)
 - Timer/ghostplayers does not sync between master and slave
 - Safari/slave: 
 - Safari/master: speech does not continue automatically
 - Safari/night confirm page: buttons not tall enough
 - with ghost players, the constable is allowed to choose themselves
   - done: FR, DE, EN, ES
	 - todo: NL

IMPORTANT:
 - right after mounting: preserve slave/master status? in localstorage?

NICE TO HAVE:
 - cleanup "connecting" bubble when hosting
 - add button "abort connecting"
 - nicer wifi icon
 - fade music out
