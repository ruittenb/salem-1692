# Moderator PWA for the card game Salem 1692

A web app for fulfilling the moderator role in the Salem 1692 card game

![Screenshots](doc/screenshots.png)

## Rationale for this App

The game [Salem 1692](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175549/salem-1692),
published by [Fa√ßade Games](https://facadegames.com/products/salem-1692)
is a game in which some of the players are witches, plotting to murder the
innocent villagers.

The game has day and night phases. During the night phase, all players
need to close their eyes so that the witches can secretly choose a
victim.  Ideally, the night phase makes use of a moderator. However,
this moderator cannot also be player.

This app takes on the role of moderator, so that all human participants
can be players. It also allows to connect to the game with multiple
smartphones, so that players don't have to reach across the table to
take a vote.
